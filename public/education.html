        <p class="education-description">
        I started off my high school carrer at Blue Valley North High School. I continued my schooling there until my Junior year, where I moved up north and started attending Staley High School, where I would end up finishing high school. While attending Staley,
        I learned that they offered a program that they called "Early College." What this program involved was for half of the school day, I would attend my high school classes as normal. But for the other half of the day, I would attend the nearby 
        Community college "Metropolitan Community College: Maple Woods." As soon as I learned about this opportunity during my Junior year, I immediately signed up for it for my Senior year.</p>
        <p class="education-description">
        During my final year of High School, in the morning I would attend classes at Maple Woods, and then I would attend classes at Staley for the last part of the day. This was the most freedom I had felt up to this point and I was thrilled to be
        taking college courses at an actual college a year earlier than I expected. Unfortunately, during my Spring semester in March of 2020, both my college and high school classes switched to online only due to Covid-19. I finished up the semester and graduated 
        high school in May 2020.
        </p>
        <p class="education-description">
            Following high school, due to Covid shutting everything down, I virtually attendended Maple Woods for one more year so I could get a large majority of my core classes completed. Following this, in Fall of 2021, I transfered to the University of
            Missouri-Kansas City where I decided I wanted to major in Computer Science. I have since been attending UMKC and am currently in my last semester where I plan to finish in December 2023 with my Bachelor's in Computer Science.
